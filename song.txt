Im callin? u
with all my goals my very soul, it fallin? through
in need of u
to trust in my faith, my tears and my ways is drownin? so
I can not always show it but don?t doubt my love
Im callin? u
with all my time and all my fights in search for truth
tryin? to reach u
see the worth of my sweat, my house, my bed
lost in sleep
will not be false in who I am as long as I breathe
